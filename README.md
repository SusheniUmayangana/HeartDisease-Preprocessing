# Heart Disease Dataset Preprocessing

This repository contains the full workflow for an individual academic assignment focused on preprocessing a heart disease dataset. It includes the original dataset, the cleaned and transformed version, a detailed report with screenshots, and the Colab notebook used for implementation.

## 📁 Contents

- `heart.csv` — Raw dataset before any modifications  
- `heart_preprocessed.csv` — Final dataset after preprocessing steps  
- `heart_disease_preprocessing.ipynb` — Colab notebook with code and comments  
- `preprocessing_report.pdf` — Full documentation of the preprocessing pipeline  

## 🧪 Preprocessing Overview

The following steps were applied to prepare the dataset for analysis:

- Data inspection and summary statistics  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling and normalization  
- Train-test split for modeling readiness
